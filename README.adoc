= Alexandre Figura's Website

This repository contains the source code of my website. But not only! This is also a
sandbox where I like to experiment new things, especially fancy testing strategies üå∂

== Overview

Written in Python (üêç), my website is based on:

- {flask}[Flask]: for the web application itself,
- {git}[Git]: to manage content and history,
- {invoke}[Invoke]: to manage my website's life cycle (e.g., updates, deployment, etc.),
- {swift}[OpenStack Swift]: to host my website in the Cloud.

Even if my workflow (focusing on portability and cost reduction) is quite common
nowadays, it was not the case when I started to work on this project:

1. **I write my website's content into text files and manage them with Git**. Very easy
   for edition: I don't have to install anything special on my computer. I can use my
   favorite text editor, and I get a Content Management System for free with Git!
2. Before running my website, **I load new content into a SQL database**, so it's easier
   to perform (complex) queries inside the codebase,
3. Finally, **I deploy my website as a set of static files in the Cloud**, rather than
   running a traditional web server, so there is less maintenance work needed.

I could have used a website generator to reach my goals, but I prefered to develop my
very own one website, in order to sharpen my programming skills, and have something
tailored to my needs (too much generators focus on making blogs only).


=== Technical Part

Under the hood, no magic, only technologies that I carefully selected for many reasons:

- {flask}[Flask] instead of {django}[Django] for the sake of simplicity,
- the {ascii}[Asciidoctor] format for my website's content, because {markdown}[Markdown]
  lacks of {markup}[semantic markup] and {rst}[reStructuredText] can be hard to use,
- a {sqlite}[SQLite] database to store the actual website's state, because it's very
  easy to backup and reuse in different environments,
- {inuit}[InuitCSS] for the design/CSS part, because I like the minimalist and OOP
  approach, compared to other bloated UI libraries,
- {os}[OpenStack] and not AWS & Co. because I prefer to support local Cloud providers,
  and am really concerned about privacy on the Web in general üïµ


== Getting Started

Want to give it a try? You are ready to go with a couple of commands:

[source,shell]
----
# Install system dependencies.
pikaur -S $(< archlinux.lock)
bower install

# Set-up a development environment.
tox -e dev --notest && . venv/bin/activate

# Launch a demo server on http://localhost:5000
invoke compile_css
invoke demo

# Run tests.
pytest
----

If you use another distribution than Archlinux, have a look inside
`archlinux.lock`, and install system dependencies manually instead! üòâ
